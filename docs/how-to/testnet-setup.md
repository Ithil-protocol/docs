# Testnet setup

---

Ithil demo runs on *Goerli* Ethereum testnet.

To use Ithil testnet you need to acquire some test ETH first that you can get from one of the faucets below:
* [Alchemix faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
* [Mudit Gupta's faucet](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/)
* [PoW faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/)
* [Some random faucet](https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/)

You will also need some test tokens to use the protocol.
We created a frontend page named *Faucet* that you can access from the menu bar on the top showing all test tokens used on our testnet and a button to send a transaction and get 1000 test tokens.

> *All testnet users who complete the given tasks will receive a custom NFT with governance power!*
