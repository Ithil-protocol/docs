# Call option
Purchase ITHIL with a discount and optionality

---

Users can deposit their tokens into Vaults and earn an APY on their deposits. However, Ithil also provides an alternative option for users who prefer more flexibility. Instead of earning the APY, users can choose to renounce it and receive a call option. This call option gives them the right, but not the obligation, to buy ITHIL tokens at a specific price that is predetermined. This way, users have the choice to either earn passive income through the APY or potentially acquire ITHIL tokens at a favorable price in the future.
