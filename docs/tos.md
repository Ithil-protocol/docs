If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must immediately discontinue any access to or use of the Platform.

## 3. ITHIL FRONTEND
Our app/frontend is a web-based user interface that enables you to interact with the underlying Protocol, which is a decentralised autonomous smart-contract system deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain networks, such as the Ethereum main network, that allows for programming and automating positions on the blockchain with higher efficiency, and certain implementations thereof (the "Protocol"). It is further expressly acknowledged that we neither control nor operate the Protocol. For more details concerning the Protocol, please refer to the information and materials available on the Website, including the documents section that may be made available at docs.ithil.fi from time to time, which information and materials are provided for the information purposes only, are not binding and do not form a part of these Terms.

The Protocol is comprised of open-sourced smart-contracts deployed on the blockchain network(s) that operate in a decentralised and autonomous manner. These smart-contacts can be reviewed, verified, used, copied, modified, and distributed by anyone (subject to the terms of the applicable license). Accordingly, there might be other interfaces enabling interaction with the Protocol that we neither control nor are affiliated with. Furthermore, anyone can interact directly with the Protocol bypassing the Ithil App and other interfaces. You should carefully and thoroughly review and assess the Protocol and related software before you use them, and any such use shall be at your own risk. You should always do your own research.

You further acknowledge that we do not control the Protocol, its underlying blockchain network, and any software through which such network is formed. Accordingly, in no event shall Ithil be responsible for or held liable in connection with the Protocol, underlying blockchain networks or software, their operation, functioning, implementation, or use, and you hereby assume and accept any and all related risks, including the risk of possible losses and damages that you may incur in connection with the use thereof.

## 4. CONNECTING DIGITAL WALLET
When using Ithil App, you may connect your Digital Wallet through one of the compatible third-party software wallets, such as, for illustration purposes only, MetaMask, TrustWallet, WalletConnect or similar software. Software wallets constitute Third-Party Services and Ithil is not responsible for, does not endorse, shall not be held liable in connection with, and does not make any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the software digital wallets used by you with the Ithil App or otherwise. When using third-party software wallets, you should review applicable terms and policies that govern your use of such software.

Ithil never receives access to or control over your Digital Wallet or Virtual Assets held in such Digital Wallet. Therefore, you are solely responsible for securing your Digital Wallet and credentials thereto (including private key, seed phrase, password, etc.) You may disconnect your Digital Wallet from the Ithil App at any time.

## 5. ELIGIBILITY
To be eligible to access and use the Platform, you must:

be able to form a legally binding agreement with Ithil on terms herein set forth;
if an individual, be at least 18 (eighteen) years of age, or of such higher age required to enter into a binding agreement with Ithil on the terms set out herein according to the laws of the jurisdiction where you reside;
neither be a Prohibited Person nor use the Platform for the benefit of a Prohibited Person;
comply with these Terms; and
use the Ithil App for your business purposes only, and not as a consumer, and you hereby further agree and acknowledge that the Ithil App is available for your commercial use only. You are not allowed to use the Ithil App in your capacity as a consumer.

## 6. IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS
You hereby acknowledge and agree that Ithil does not provide any custodial or similar services, custodial solutions, or software, does not act as your agent or representative, and does not control, manage, or custody any of your Virtual Assets.

Ithil shall not be responsible for or held liable in connection with any operations carried out by you, any other user, or group of users with the Ithil App or through the Protocol, including any receipt, transfer, use, or storing of Virtual Assets. All transactions between the users of the Protocol are peer-to-peer, which means that the users interact directly with each other using their Digital Wallets. Ithil does not act as an intermediary in any transaction and shall not be responsible for ensuring that any transaction made through the Ithil App or otherwise on the blockchain is actually completed or performed. Ithil does not control or influence transactions with Virtual Assets and therefore is unable to cancel, reverse, block, or freeze any transactions conducted by you or any other user. It is your responsibility to ensure that all your transactions comply with the requirements of the laws and regulations applicable to you.

Virtual Assets are extremely volatile which means that their value and applicable exchange rates may change dramatically in a very short time depending on various factors and forces. Furthermore, the composition of Virtual Assets supplied to certain Third-Party Services (such as AMMs), whether through the Protocol or otherwise, may change, their value may go up or down, or drop significantly. Ithil does not facilitate or intermediate your interactions with the Protocol or Third-Party Services, and shall not be responsible for or held liable in connection with any damages or losses that you may incur as a result of or in connection with the change in the composition, value or price of your Virtual Assets.

Ithil is not your broker, fund manager, or any intermediary to any broker or fund manager. Neither the Platform nor the Protocol or anything in these Terms shall be considered as broker and/or fund management services, or any intermediation services thereto.

Neither the Platform nor Ithil provides financial advisory, legal, regulatory, or tax services directly, indirectly, implicitly, or in any other manner, and you should not consider any content contained in these Terms, information or materials provided by Ithil (or on our behalf) to be a substitute for professional financial, legal, regulatory, tax, or other advice.

The Platform, including any information and materials available thereon, is not intended to constitute an offer of securities or Virtual Assets, or a solicitation for investment in or purchase of securities or Virtual Assets in any jurisdiction, nor is it intended to constitute a prospectus or offer document of any type. We do not provide any opinion or any advice to purchase, sell, or otherwise transact with Virtual Assets, and nothing communicated by Ithil shall form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Please consult your own legal or financial advisor before making any decision, and always do your own research.

## 7. WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS

## 20. WAIVER OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES
These Terms, the Platform, any other service or product provided by Ithil are not intended to create or impose any fiduciary duty on Ithil with respect to you.

## 22. TRANSACTIONS
Transactions carried out with the use of the Platform on the blockchain are irreversible and final. You may not claim refunds or cancel transactions once they are processed by the blockchain network. You are solely responsible for any transactions carried out with the use of the Platform, including on the blockchain, and you will carefully appraise and assess the risks involved in every such transaction before it is made. Furthermore, you hereby acknowledge that Virtual Assets are highly volatile due to multiple factors including but not limited to speculation, lack of regulation, regulatory, security risks, other factors and circumstances. The price of a Virtual Asset may change dramatically and rapidly, and certain Virtual Assets may lose their value entirely; you shall not hold Ithil or Ithil Parties responsible for or liable in connection with the foregoing and hereby assume all such risks. You shall solely make all decisions with regard to your transactions, and shall be solely responsible for their consequences, including possible losses and damages.

For the avoidance of doubt, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to these Terms.

## 25. DISPUTES RESOLUTION
Except for any Disputes in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Ithil hereby agree to settle and finally resolve any Dispute arising out of or in connection with the Platform, these Terms and any matters contemplated herein in binding arbitration and in accordance with this Section 25. Binding arbitration is the referral of a Dispute to a qualified person(s) who will review the Dispute and make a final and binding determination, by making an order, to resolve the Dispute.

For any Dispute that you have against Ithil or relating to the Platform, these Terms or any matters contemplated herein, you shall first contact Ithil and attempt to resolve the Dispute informally by sending a notice to Ithil by email at *info@ithil.fi*. The notice must include your name, address and email, and such other information necessary to identify you or assess your inquiry, describe the nature and basis of the Dispute and set forth the specific relief sought. If Ithil and you cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the LCIA, in accordance with the terms set forth below.

Any Disputes arising out of or in connection with the Platform, these Terms or any matters contemplated herein, including any question regarding the existence, validity, or termination of these Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the binding arbitration under the London Court of International Arbitration rules, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference herein. Any arbitration will occur in London, UK. You will not and hereby waive your rights to object to the arbitration prescribed herein.

Unless otherwise required by the applicable law, and to the maximum extent permitted and possible, you, Ithil, and the arbitrators shall maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Disputes. Unless prohibited under the law, the arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality.

Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Ithil and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding in any circumstances. There will be no class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration where an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.

To the maximum extent permitted under the applicable law, you and Ithil waive the rights to a jury trial, class action arbitration, and to have any Dispute resolved in court.

To the maximum extent permitted under the applicable law, you and Ithil hereby agree that any claim arising out of or related to the Platform, Protocol, these Terms or any matters contemplated herein shall be filed within one (1) year after the ground for such claim arose; if the claim is not filed within this term, such claim shall be permanently barred, which means that neither you, nor Ithil will have the right to assert such claim.

## 26. COMMUNICATION

## 28. NO WAIVER
No failure or delay by Ithil to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms or law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

## 29. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
