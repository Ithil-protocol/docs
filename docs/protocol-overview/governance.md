# Governance
How we manage a thriving community

---

## DAO

Ithil will gradually evolve into a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). Token holders, collectively known as *governance*, will make key choices, with a flourishing community of users, LPs, and those who want to improve the protocol itself. These contributors will be compensated with governance tokens from Ithil's treasury. We plan to attract designers, developers, finance experts, traders and marketers to work on a variety of side projects and spin-offs, such as adding additional services. The protocol will be regularly expanded with additional services thanks to the community, as a way to democratise and distribute Ithil's development and progress.

A non-exhaustive list of potential governance-based decisions is as follows:
- Listing or de-listing of a token or a service.
- Assess the risk factor of a particular token within a service.
- Boost or damp one stablecoin's APY using the treasury's liquidity.
- Initiate and manage liquidity mining activities.
Each time, an ITHIL token holder can stake his or her tokens and participate in the voting, proportionately to the number of tokens owned and staked.

### The treasury

All Ithil's decisions and community building cannot take place without a solid treasury. Ithil's treasury is entirely made of ITHIL tokens, which will be used for various important tasks such as the following.
- Pay for community mining and marketing activities.
- Allowing APY boosts for particular vaults.
- Investing in airdrops and external activities.
Each time, the DAO will propose and let all ITHIL holders decide about Ithil's resolution.

## The $ITHIL token

The $ITHIL token is a utility token that is vital for the protocol.
It can be freely exchanged on popular dexes or staked on Ithil to earn a share of the protocol revenue.
The tokens can be locked for a certain period of time, the longer the user locks their tokens for, the share of the protocol revenue they will be entitled to; fees are collected from all Vaults and paid in WETH.
Token lockers will receive $veITHIL, a non transferrable token with governance power that allows them to vote on the protocol's future. At the same time, iToken holders (liquidity providers in the Vaults) have veto rights over governance decisions: in this way, a system of checks and balances is created, in which the protocol's future is decided by the community of users and liquidity providers.
