## Governance token

Governance tokens ITH are vital for Ithil's growth and sustainability. Ithil's governance token holders participate in governance decisions, perform liquidations and earn from them and get rewards in the form of an ever-increasing backing system coming from all these activities.

### Liquidations

When Ithil tokens are staked in the liquidation contract, the staker can perform liquidation and earn in a way described in the liquidation section. The amount to be liquidated in a single call increases with the amount of ITH staked. As the liquidated amount increases, the ITH staked are gradually "unblocked" until all ITH can be unstaked from the liquidation contract, together with the earnings from the liquidation activity.

### Rewards

ITH is backed in a specific backing contract similar to Ithil's vault. The price per share calculated by the contract is so that every circulating (i.e. outside the backing contract) ITH can be redeemed at any moment at that price, thus assuring the rewards accumulated by ITH holders are distributed. Moreover, redeeming ITH on the backing contract does not change the price, as it can be seen by a direct calculation.

The stablecoins inside the backing contract can come from various sources, such as
- Excess insurance reserve above the optimal ratio.
- Direct ITH exchange on the backing contract.
- Profits from separate treasury's investments.

The key takeaway is the fact that *there is no way to extract stablecoins from the backing contract, except redeeming ITH*. In this way, the backing price of ITH can never decrease, while there are various ways in which it can increase. A ITH holder will then see the backing price of ITH always go up in time, a system which strongly encourages to commit to the community for a long time.

## Ithil's DAO

Ithil will progressively become a DAO - decentralised autonomous organisation. Core decisions will be taken by token holders, collectively referred as *governance*, with a thriving community of traders, LPs as well as people who put in work for the advancement of the protocol itself. As a reward, these contributors will be paid in governance tokens taken from Ithil's treasury. We foresee onboard designers, developers, financial experts, traders and marketers to work on several different side-projects and spin-offs like adding new strategies. Thanks to the community, the protocol will constantly enrich with new strategies by using community inputs as a way to democratise and distribute the development and progress of Ithil itself.
A non-exhaustive list of possible governance-based decisions is:
- Listing or de-listing of a token or a strategy.
- Assess the risk factor of a particular token within a strategy.
- Boost or damp one stablecoin's APY using the treasury's liquidity.
- Initiate and manage liquidity mining activities.
Each time, an ITH token holder can stake his or her tokens and participate in the voting, proportionately to the number of tokens owned and staked.

### The treasury

All Ithil's decisions and community building cannot take place without a solid treasury. Ithil's treasury is entirely made of ITH tokens, which will be used for various important tasks such as the following.
- Pay for community mining and marketing activities.
- Allowing APY boosts for particular vaults.
- Investing in airdrops and external activities.
Each time, the DAO will propose and let all ITH holders decide about Ithil's resolution.
