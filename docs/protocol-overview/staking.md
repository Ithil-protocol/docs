# Staking
Liquidity provisioning to the Vault

---

Any user can supply any supported ERC20 token to the protocol, regardless of which chain their tokens live upon. The fees generated by the traders' activity will be redistributed to LPs, so that their staked assets will increase in number. If you give DAI, you will receive more DAI. No synth assets or strange tokens to swap.
LPs will receive a yield-bearing token representing their deposit, that can be exchanged on dexes, used as collateral or put into farming on other DeFi protocols. When a LP wants to redeem their staked tokens, their yield-bearing tokens will be burned and the underlying liquidity will be transfered with the fees accrued.
