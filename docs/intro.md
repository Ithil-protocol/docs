Ithil was born at the peak of the 2021 bull run, when DeFi was booming and new protocols were being implemented on a regular basis.
The year of maturity was then 2022, when the bull market enthusiasm died down and the web3 area reached a more thoughtful condition, focused on providing actual value and creating real yield.

The fundamental issue Ithil was created to address is the fragmentation of the web3 space into numerous niches, such as DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, Gaming, and so on, in order to make it more fair.
