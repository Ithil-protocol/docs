## Introduction


Ithil is a **generalised leveraged investments protocol** allowing liquidity providers to stake any ERC20 token and earn fees in that same  (eg. stake DAI get more DAI, put SHIBA get more SHIBA) and to traders to use the available liquidity to run investments with a higher capital than their initial one (i.e. *a leverage*). This is possible thanks to internal **undercollateralised loans** where the protocol *Vault* makes its liquidity available to the traders to run investment *strategies*, which will eventually repay the loan and deliver the profits, if any, to the trader. In order to use the vault's liquidity, the trader needs to pay a **margin** to the desired investment strategy: it will cover eventual losses, but it is given back to the trader in full in case of a profitable investment. When the value of an investment falls behind some critical threshold, external **liquidators** can forcefully close the position, getting a reward by doing so. 
The vault's liquidity is given by **liquidity providers**, which stake any ERC20 token in the vault and earn the fees generated by the investment process. **Governance token** holders can stake their tokens to perform decentralised liquidation and get rewards in the vault's tokens and can cast their vote in the DAO. A simple and solid backing system mathematically insures the dollar value of the governance token can only increase and never go below a certain floor, thus privileging holders committing to Ithil's community for a long time.


## Liquidations

Liquidations are a fundamental part in the echosystem: closing positions getting too close to having their margin completely eroded (more precisely, beyond a strategy-specific percentage called the **risk factor**), they protect the vault's liquidity and prevent the share price of LP tokens to decrease. In this way, liquidity providers are guaranteed to receive a positive APY with a very low risk.

Ithil's liquidation system is completely decentralised and onchain: anyone which holds a sufficient amount of Ithil's governance token can launch Ithil's liquidation functions which will check onchain, using the *quoter* function of the particular strategy, if a given position is liquidable. Liquidators can close one or more positions in one go, thus saving gas and performing a faster liquidation. Once a position is liquidated, the part of the margin which is not eroded is transferred in full to the liquidator: in this way, a faster liquidation will assure the liquidator a higher reward. If the margin is not sufficient to reward the liquidator, we consider this a **bad liquidation**: in this case, a part of the insurance reserve is used to restore the eventual liquidity loss and to compensate the liquidator.

Liquidation is therefore a profitable activity: the best liquidator will have fast and precise bots which quickly identify liquidable positions and launch the liquidation process. Precision is important because, if a liquidator tries to close a non-liquidable position, the liquidation does not take place and the gas is lost.+

There are three possible liquidations to be performed on Ithil.
- **Closing positions**: the liquidator closes one or more positions in behalf of the users, getting the users' margins or part of the insurance reserve if this is not enough. This is the most gas-intensive and risky (closing big positions can have a large market impact, thus reducing the reward), but the potential gains are higher.
- **Margin calls**: the liquidator tops up the position's margin and becomes the owner of the position. This is the cheapest and less gas-intensive form of liquidation, moreover in this way the liquidator can enter the same investment as the previous user, thus if market moves favorably an easy gain can be done. However, the risk for the liquidator is to be in turn liquidated if the market moves unfavorably.
- **Total cover**: the liquidator repays the loan and the fees to the vault and receives the assets locked in the strategy in her or his wallet. This stands in the middle in terms of gas and leaves to the liquidator the choice to arbitrage by immediately selling the received assets, or keeping them for another purpose.

In order to liquidate, liquidators need to stake their Ithil's governance tokens in the liquidation contract: when a good amount of liquidations have been performed, such governance tokens can be withdrawn.

## Governance token

Governance tokens ITH are vital for Ithil's growth and sustainability. Ithil's governance token holders participate in governance decisions, perform liquidations and earn from them and get rewards in the form of an ever-increasing backing system coming from all these activities.

### Liquidations

When Ithil tokens are staked in the liquidation contract, the staker can perform liquidation and earn in a way described in the liquidation section. The amount to be liquidated in a single call increases with the amount of ITH staked. As the liquidated amount increases, the ITH staked are gradually "unblocked" until all ITH can be unstaked from the liquidation contract, together with the earnings from the liquidation activity.

### Rewards

ITH is backed in a specific backing contract similar to Ithil's vault. The price per share calculated by the contract is so that every circulating (i.e. outside the backing contract) ITH can be redeemed at any moment at that price, thus assuring the rewards accumulated by ITH holders are distributed. Moreover, redeeming ITH on the backing contract does not change the price, as it can be seen by a direct calculation.

The stablecoins inside the backing contract can come from various sources, such as
- Excess insurance reserve above the optimal ratio.
- Direct ITH exchange on the backing contract.
- Profits from separate treasury's investments.

The key takeaway is the fact that *there is no way to extract stablecoins from the backing contract, except redeeming ITH*. In this way, the backing price of ITH can never decrease, while there are various ways in which it can increase. A ITH holder will then see the backing price of ITH always go up in time, a system which strongly encourages to commit to the community for a long time.

## Ithil's DAO

Ithil will progressively become a DAO - decentralised autonomous organisation. Core decisions will be taken by token holders, collectively referred as *governance*, with a thriving community of traders, LPs as well as people who put in work for the advancement of the protocol itself. As a reward, these contributors will be paid in governance tokens taken from Ithil's treasury. We foresee onboard designers, developers, financial experts, traders and marketers to work on several different side-projects and spin-offs like adding new strategies. Thanks to the community, the protocol will constantly enrich with new strategies by using community inputs as a way to democratise and distribute the development and progress of Ithil itself.
A non-exhaustive list of possible governance-based decisions is:
- Listing or de-listing of a token or a strategy.
- Assess the risk factor of a particular token within a strategy.
- Boost or damp one stablecoin's APY using the treasury's liquidity.
- Initiate and manage liquidity mining activities.
Each time, an ITH token holder can stake his or her tokens and participate in the voting, proportionately to the number of tokens owned and staked.

### The treasury

All Ithil's decisions and community building cannot take place without a solid treasury. Ithil's treasury is entirely made of ITH tokens, which will be used for various important tasks such as the following.
- Pay for community mining and marketing activities.
- Allowing APY boosts for particular vaults.
- Investing in airdrops and external activities.
Each time, the DAO will propose and let all ITH holders decide about Ithil's resolution.

## Conclusions

With Ithil, we bring a new generation experience of DeFi investments, thanks to undercollateralised loans and an unmatched protection and growth system. Thanks to the leverage, all users can earn high profits only from their own market insights, even if their initial wealth is not high. Liquidations and fair distribution make Ithil attractive also for stakers willing to have a slow and steady return on *any* token (a rare possibility in the DeFi world), while a solid tokenomics and a mathematically increasing backing will make investing in ITH a no-brainer.

### Key takeaways
* Internal undercollateralised leverage system
* Trade any ERC20 token, including meme/gaming tokens and fractionalised NFTs
* Fully on-chain, can be integrated in other protocols
* Gas optimisation and liquidity aggregation via multi-chain routing
* Efficient liquidation via a network of bots that anyone can run
* Several strategies to choose from, with different risk and reward levels

### Why is Ithil different from other protocols on the market
* **Cross-chain** diversified portfolio of popular DeFi **strategies**.
* **Undercollateralised leverage** to boost your profits.
* The protocol is chain-independent, you can execute a strategy on Polygon while having your assets on Ethereum mainnet
* Liquidity providers get **rewarded with their favourite token**, thus allowing them to stake virtually any crypto asset (supported by Ithil). Usually, other protocols reward liquidity providers with governance tokens.
* Flexible trading experience with (almost) **any type of token allowed as margin**, sophisticated charts and good market rates will attract more traders to us. Typical margin trading platforms are hard to use, gas intensive and ultimately unattractive or just support a handful of tokens.
* The **governance token will be inflationary**: backed by the protocol earnings and giving opportunity to earn even more by providing support to the platform.

## Who is behind it
The idea started when three developers with diverse backgrounds met during a hackathon. In our discussions, it was clear that the DeFi world lacked a consistent way to provide liquidity and earn income in the same token staked and that the existing protocols are so rigid in nature, that they struggle to keep pace with the fast growing DeFi world. At the same time, most traders were struggling to find easy ways to execute repetitive strategies on multiple chains. 
We iterated on that, took some ideas from traditional finance and translated them into crypto language: our goal was initially to create a platform which only allowed margin trading, but we then realised that our project had much bigger potential since the earning system of the vault (the core of our protocol) is agnostic of the investment activity. Now that the core is robust and well-refined, we are heading to creating the largest diversified investment platform available in the market.
We prefer to stay anonymous as want the project and its DAO to be the real and public facade and by being anon the team can totally focus on providing value to the community.
