## What's the difference between APR and APY?
APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the yearly interest, minus fees. This does not include compounding effects that occur from reinvesting profits. If you were to invest $100 with 100% APR, you would make $100 in profit in a year time.
If you however reinvest your profits regularly, you will compound your interest. This calculated over a year gives you your APY (Annual Percentage Yield). The more often you compound your interest, the greater the difference between APR and APY.

## How does APY work?
APY is the annual percentage yield offered from a particular investment. This takes into account compound interest, giving you an accurate idea of your returns compared to simple interest.
Large APYs in the percentage of thousands are possible with investments that provide daily yields of 1% or more. Due to your liquidity pool rewards being constantly farmed and reinvested, the interest compounds on larger and larger amounts.
Who can whitelist tokens?
