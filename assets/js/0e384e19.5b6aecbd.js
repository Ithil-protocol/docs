At the same time, most traders were struggling to find easy ways to execute repetitive strategies on multiple chains.\nWe iterated on that, took some ideas from traditional finance and translated them into crypto language: our goal was initially to create a platform which only allowed margin trading, but we then realised that our project had much bigger potential since the earning system of the vault (the core of our protocol) is agnostic of the investment activity. Now that the core is robust and well-refined, we are heading to creating the largest diversified investment platform available in the market.\nWe prefer to stay anonymous as want the project and its DAO to be the real and public facade and by being anon the team can totally focus on providing value to the community."),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"how-can-i-get-in-touch-with-you"},"How can I get in touch with you"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"We are available on Discord or Twitter, ping us there and we will be happy to answer!"))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
