The logic behind is that, the higher the token volatility, the more likely the value of the entitlement will fall below the threshold defined by the risk factor, and we do not want that a more likely event will trigger a liquidation (otherwise, too many positions will be liquidable, which we want to avoid)."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},1748:function(e,t,a){var n={"./locale":9234,"./locale.js":9234};function r(e){var t=s(e);return a(t)}function s(e){if(!a.o(n,e)){var t=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw t.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",t}return n[e]}r.keys=function(){return Object.keys(n)},r.resolve=s,e.exports=r,r.id=1748}}]);
