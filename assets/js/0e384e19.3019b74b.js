The protocol takes a fixed and a percentual fee on borrowed assets and redistributes it to governance token holders and a small percentage to the developers behind it. We make strategies simple and intuitive for any investor to take part in: via a set of smart contracts and several investment strategies, Ithil help users maximise their rewards from various liquidity pools (LPs), automated market makers (AMM), yield aggregators, staking pools and other income bearing opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem.

At the same time, most investors were struggling to find easy ways to execute repetitive strategies on multiple chains.\nWe iterated on that, took some ideas from traditional finance and translated them into crypto language: our goal was initially to create a platform which only allowed margin trading, but we then realized that our project had much bigger potential since the earning system of the vault (the core of our protocol) is agnostic of the investment activity.
