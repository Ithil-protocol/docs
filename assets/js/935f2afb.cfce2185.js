This is possible thanks to internal undercollateralized loans where the vault lends its liquidity to the strategies, which will eventually repay the loan and deliver the gains to the investor. In order to use the vault\'s liquidity, the investor needs to pay a margin to the desired strategy: this will cover eventual losses, but is given back to the investor in full in the case of a profitable investment. When the value of an investment falls behind some critical threshold, external liquidators can close the position forcefully, getting rewards by doing so. Governance token holders can provide liquidity to boost the vault\'s APY and earn rewards in stablecoins, or can stake their tokens to perform a decentralized liquidation and get rewards in the vault\'s tokens, besides being able to vote in the DAO\'s decisions. A simple and solid backing system mathematically insures the dollar value of the governance token never to go below an always increasing floor, thus privileging holders committing to Ithil\'s community for a long time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/how-it-works":{"id":"protocol-overview/how-it-works","title":"How it works","description":"Take a look under the hood","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/lending":{"id":"protocol-overview/lending","title":"lending","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/staking":{"id":"protocol-overview/staking","title":"staking","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial":{"id":"tutorial","title":"Tutorial","description":"Let\'s discover Ithil in less than 5 minutes with this quick intro.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
